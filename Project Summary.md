Project Summary: I built a responsive full-stack Task Manager using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Key features include full CRUD capabilities, task prioritization (low/medium/high), and a filter system to toggle between pending and completed tasks. One challenge I faced was managing the state between the form and the list components to ensure the UI updated immediately after adding a task without a page refresh. Through this project, I solidified my understanding of REST API design, React hooks (useState/useEffect), and how to deploy a full-stack application using Render and Vercel.
